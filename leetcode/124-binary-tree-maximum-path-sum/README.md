Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
---

Given a __non-empty__ binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain __at least one node__ and does not need to go through the root.

__Example 1__:

```
Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6
```

__Example 2__:

```
Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

      -10
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7

Output: 42
```
