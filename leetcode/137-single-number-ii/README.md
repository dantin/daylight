Single Number II
---

Given a __non-empty__ array of integers, every element appears _three_ times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

__Note__:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

__Example 1__:

```
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

__Example 2__:

```
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```
